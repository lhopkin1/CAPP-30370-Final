						<h2>Location</h2>
						<p>For my entire life, I have called the small town of Ironton, Ohio home. As 
						shown in the map below, Ironton is found in southern Ohio as part of the 
						Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia tri&ndash;state area. The foothills of 
						the Appalachian Mountains run through the area, which is reflected 
						in the history and culture of the people. It has been a great place 
						to grow up and my experiences there are a very important part of who I 
						am today.</p>

						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>Ironton was founded in 1849 by John Campbell, who was a prominent pig 
						iron manufacturer in the area. Interested in expanding his foundry business, 
						and due to the area's rich iron&ndash;ore content in the hills to the north, he 
						became interested in the lands surrounding what would later become the city 
						of Ironton. The location of Ironton was chosen for its position along the 
						Ohio River, which would allow for transport of the much&ndash;needed commodity, 
						iron&ndash;ore, and the slope of the land itself, which facilitated movement of 
						the raw material to the local blast furnaces.</p>
						<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s and two major floods (1917, 1937) devastated 
						the city to the point that most if not all the city&apos;s industries had closed down 
						for good. Nevertheless, some commerce remained; the Norfolk and Western Railway 
						built a new railroad station downtown in 1906, and it continued in operation 
						throughout the period. As the iron industries closed, Ironton had little with 
						which to replace them.</p>
						<p>A labor&ndash;oriented town, Ironton managed to keep alive 
						by trying to attract heavy industry to the region. Companies like Allied Signal 
						and Alpha Portland Cement did build in town. The continued dependency on labor 
						industries has severely hurt the region as a whole, and Ironton even more so. By 
						2004, both Alpha Portland Cement and Allied Signal were gone, and Ironton had shrunk 
						by almost 50%.<br><em>Source: Wikipedia</em></p>

						<h2>Demographics</h2>
						<p>As of the census of 2010, there were 11,129 people, 4,817 households, and 2,882 
						families residing in the city. The population density was 2,675.2 inhabitants per square 
						mile. There were 5,382 housing units at an average density of 1,293.8 per square mile. 
						The racial makeup of the city was 92.6% White, 4.7% African American, 0.2% Native American, 
						0.3% Asian, 0.1% from other races, and 2.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of 
						any race were 0.5% of the population.</p>
						<p>There were 4,817 households of which 28.1% had children under the age of 18 living with 
						them, 39.0% were married couples living together, 15.3% had a female householder with no 
						husband present, 5.5% had a male householder with no wife present, and 40.2% were non&ndash;families. 
						The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.87.</p>
						<p>Like much of Appalachia, Ironton has a fairly high level of poverty. From 2007 to 2011, 
						the median household income for the same was &#36;31,462. For the same time period, 
						21.0% of residents lived below the poverty level. This is most likely partially due to 
						low levels of education; as of 2011 only 15.3% of residents 25 and older held a bachelor's 
						degree or higher.<br><em>Sources: Wikipedia, Census Bureau</em></p>
